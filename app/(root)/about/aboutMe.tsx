                Hey there! I'm Shivesh, a dedicated and enthusiastic Full Stack Developer with a lifelong passion for coding. My journey into the world of programming began when I was just 11 years old, tinkering with Visual Basic and realizing the incredible power of bringing ideas to life through code. Since then, I've embarked on an exciting learning adventure, exploring languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, honing my skills to create immersive digital experiences.

Building full-stack websites has become my forte, and I've delighted in crafting interactive social media platforms, engaging blog applications, and even website clones, where I challenged myself to recreate some of the web's most popular destinations.
